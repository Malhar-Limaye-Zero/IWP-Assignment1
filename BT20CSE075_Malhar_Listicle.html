            <p>
                Based on technology from Siemens, Smart Factory is automated way of controlling and managing the manufacturing process in a factory using Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things technologies.The purpose of the Smart Factory Lab is primarily to introduce the concept of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). Smart Factory Laboratory provides candidates with many challenging hands-on experiences such as manufacturing design and control. It is the state-of-the-art laboratory consisting of various equipment including material processing - computer numerically (CNC) controlled machine centers (mill and lathe), material handling - KUKA Collaborative robots, material transportation (AGV), conveyor system, and material inspection , vision based system. The materials are stored in AS/RS (automated storage and retrieval system)

            <div class="section-heading">Mechatronics Lab</div>
            <a class="location" href="https://vnit.ac.in/vrjscoe/facilities.html">Mechatronics Lab,Siemens Centre of Excellence VNIT</a>

            <p>

                Based on technology from Siemens, the Lab teaches Automation (Mechatronics).Mechatronics is defined as a field that integrates multiple disciplines such as mechanical, electronics, control, instrumentation and programming, that enables operators, technicians, supervisors, managers and designers to design, optimize, operate and maintain real world automation processes, that comprise of these multiple technologies. The Mechatronic lab brings together four departments of engineering, namely Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics & Communication and Computer Science. This allow Trainees to work on a mini factory like setup and on areas such as Pneumatic s & Hydraulics, Sensors, Communication Protocol, PLC programming, PLC Networking using PROFIBUS and PROFINET.
