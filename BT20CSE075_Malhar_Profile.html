                        Data Structures Assignment-Phonebook Management System:<p>
                            Developed a phone-book management system with functionalities such as
                            adding, removing and finding contacts in C language. Implemented insertion, searching and deletion in linear time complexity
                            using sorted linked lists. Achieved logarithmic order of time complexity by using self balancing AVL
                            trees as the data structure.

                        Quadrupedal Robotic:<p>
                            Designed and fabricated a quadrupedal robotic system capable of
                            omni-directional motion. Implemented the inverse kinematics of each leg and built algorithms for
                            generating trajectories for the feet of the robot by treating each leg as a 3R
                            manipulator. Tested these walking gaits by deploying them on the fabricated hardware
                            robot.

                            Implemented and tested kinematic and dynamic control algorithms on
                            Manipulator robots. Derived the forward and inverse kinematics of a 3R manipulator using
                            Sympy and Matplotlib. Simulated position control and velocity control on a 6-DoF manipulator by
                            applying trajectory generation methods such as polynomial interpolation,
                            cubic splines and Beizer curves in PyBullet using python. Accomplished the Pick and Place task using position control and trajectory
                            generation. Implemented control algorithms such as PD torque control, computed torque
                            control and impedance control based on the dynamics of manipulators.

                        Maze Solver Robot:<p>
                            Developed a wall following algorithm based on local mapping to solve simply-connected mazes for the differential drive robot. Accomplished local mapping by use of a LIDAR sensor mounted on the
                            robot. Deployed and tested this algorithm on the robot in multiple simply-connected mazes using ROS-Gazebo and Python
